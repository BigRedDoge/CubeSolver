# CubeSolver

This is a Rubik's Cube solver written in Javascript.  After inputing the colors of each side, it calculates a solution.  It outputs each step of the solution by listing the color to turn clockwise or counterclockwise (if it says "inverted").  I might add OpenCV image recognition to have it find a solution from pictures of each side.
